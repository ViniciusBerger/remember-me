# 🏗️ remember-me — *Under Development*  

🚧🚧🚧 **UNDER CONSTRUCTION — ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK** 🚧🚧🚧  

Welcome to the official construction site of **remember-me**, a project held together by:
- hope  
- duct tape  
- and one severely overworked developer (me)  

---

## 🚧 Warning: Active Work Zone

This is a highly unstable area.  
You may experience:
- falling bugs  
- a few print lines  
- sudden existential crises caused by stack traces  

Proceed with caution. And coffee.

## 👷 Meet the Entire Construction Crew

Since this is a one-person operation, here are all the roles I currently occupy:

| Role           | Employee | Notes                                                 |
|----------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Foreman        | Me       | Shouts at bugs until they leave                      |
| Architect      | Me       | Designed something once and regretted it instantly   |
| Electrician    | Me       | Wires Spring Boot together with fragile optimism     |
| Plumber        | Me       | Routes data through JPA pipes until something bursts |
| Safety Officer | Me       | Violates every rule I write                          |
| QA Tester      | Me       | Approves my own PRs with zero shame                  |
| Intern         | Me       | Googles everything                                   |
| Therapist      | ChatGPT  | “You are absolutely right.”                          |

## 🧰 Tools Used on This Job Site

- 🔧 **Java + Spring Boot** — the steel beams of the building  
- 🧱 **JPA / Hibernate** — sometimes holds the structure together  
- 🏗️ **Maven** — crane operator, occasionally drops heavy objects  
- 🧪 **Mockito** — interrogates the code until it confesses  
- 📝 **JUnit** — official inspector (always disappointed)  
- 🐳 **Docker** — keeps the infrastructure floating (most of the time)  
- 🗄️ **MySQL in a Docker container** — the database lives inside a shipping container, very on-theme for “deployment”

## 🏢 Project Overview

The **remember-me** application helps myself create reminders so I don’t forget to take the dog for a walk…  
And it can help you too... soon.

So far our features include:

- adding reminders  
- editing reminders  
- deleting reminders  
- crying softly when tests fail  

More features coming soon™ (hopefully).

## 💾 Infrastructure & Database

- Backend: Spring Boot application  
- Database: **MySQL** running inside a **Docker container**  
- Communication: Spring Data JPA talks to MySQL through carefully duct-taped configs  

If the app crashes, it’s probably not MySQL’s fault.  
(It’s probably mine.)

---

## 🔨 How to Build the Site

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViniciusBerger/remember-me.git
cd remember-me
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Make sure your MySQL Docker container is up and running before starting the app
(or enjoy a flood of stack traces).

## 📌 Final Notes

This project is built with coffee, chaos, and lots of late-night debugging.
Enjoy your stay at the remember-me construction site, and feel free to:

- admire the craftsmanship
- give me a feedback!

## 👷‍♂️👷‍♀️ Hard hats optional but recommended.
